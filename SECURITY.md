# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest commit on `main` is actively supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email kevin@premialab.com with a clear description and reproduction steps. Do not open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation within 14 days.

## Security Practices

- Secrets and credentials are loaded from environment variables, never committed to source.

> **Note:** API-key authentication is implemented for REST, gRPC, A2A, and MCP and is enabled by default (`SQT_AUTH_ENABLED=true`). TLS termination and dependency scanning are not yet implemented. Deploy behind a reverse proxy that provides TLS. Audit records are written on every agent-tool dispatch; the `STANDARD_TOOLS_AUDIT_ENABLED` variable referenced in `.mise.toml` is not currently consumed by the application.
